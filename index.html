        <h1>TouchLib</h1>

<p>TouchLib is a basic UX library that provides a modular/minimalist approach towards gesture recognition. The basic version of the library provides several built-in gestures:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tap</li>
<li>Long tap</li>
<li>Drag</li>
<li>Pinch</li>
</ul><p>More gestures can be added, as described in the section below (Adding new gestures).</p>

<h2>Development</h2>

<p>If you're interested in helping development, just fork this project. I won't pull your changes, since I'd prefer for the code to remain solely mine.</p>

<h2>History</h2>

<p>Touchlib came about because Android lacks a builtin library (or any open source library) for quick and easy gesture recognition. While Android does include a "Gesture" library, it does not work with a multitouch Pinch gesture, nor does it provide ongoing information about a gesture, such as the location, duration, or other such information. When the information is available, it is hidden behind cumbersome APIs that impose a significant performance hit.</p>

<p>As such, I sat down one weekend and built TouchLib to handle some basic gestures that I needed for a game. The first version was fugly, but it worked. Then I sat down a few days later, and came up with a sane design. A little bit of javadoc later, and I'm here, writing this document at 330am. Yay!</p>

<h2>Integrating with your application</h2>

<p>To use this library, you'll need to forward all MotionEvents to the GestureManager in the onTouchEvent(MotionEvent) method of your View. GestureManager provides a default instance, but you can maintain your own, if you'd like. Maintaining multiple GestureManagers is not supported (it should be possible, but I just haven't tried it/thought it through). In addition, you'll want to add a listener for the gesture events. BaseGestureListener provides a default implementation of GestureListener, which does nothing. That way, you can override only the events you care about. In addition, it funnels all the gesture lifecycle events into a simple event (so onStartDrag, onMidDrag, and onEndDrag all call onDrag by default).</p>

<p>The example project provides a reference for how to utilize the library in a semi-sane manner.</p>

<p>Paid support is provided upon request. Donations via paypal are also welcome.</p>

<h2>Adding new gestures</h2>

<p>If you'd like to add a new gesture, you'll need to first write a new processor that extends GestureProcessor. The handle* methods should be overridden to handle the various MotionEvent types. Then you'll need to add a new entry to the GestureType enum, and finally a new instance to the GestureManager. Once you've done all that, you'll need to tell the existing processors when to pass control over to your processor.</p>
